# Jozu Brand Guide

Welcome to our official Jozu brand guide. This repository contains all the essential information, assets, and guidelines for using our brand consistently across all channels and materials.

## Brand Overview

A new identity inspired by effortless mastery. The core themes of the Jozu brand — security, speed, and ease of use (expressed through flow) — are drawn directly from the platform itself and the meaning behind its name.

"Jozu," rooted in Japanese culture, conveys a sense of effortless mastery — a reflection of how the product empowers developers to build with confidence, velocity, and simplicity.

Your brand guide serves as a centralized resource for all brand elements, clearly organized by category and supported with examples to ensure consistent application across a range of environments and touchpoints.

### Core Values

- **Security** - Protection and balance, bringing security to complex AI systems
- **Speed** - Enabling developers to work with velocity
- **Flow** - Creating an intuitive, seamless experience
- **Simplicity** - Making complex processes approachable and easy to use

## Logo

### Concept

The Jozu logo lockup is the foundational symbol of the brand's identity — a visual representation of precision, skill, flow, and security. The bold monogram shield, split into two mirrored forms, conveys both protection and balance, echoing the brand's mission to bring security and elegance to complex AI systems. The two sides of the shield also depict the platform's ability to unite AI/ML & app development teams in a secure way.

Paired with the clean, confident wordmark, the lockup reflects a seamless blend of engineering clarity and design intentionality. The wordmark is a mono typeface with a custom letter J that was used to form the shield mark. This lockup should be used in primary brand placements to establish trust, communicate authority, and signal a product experience that is both powerful and intuitively structured.

### Clearspace

To ensure the logo always appears at its best, it's important to maintain clear space around it. This breathing room protects its visibility and impact across all applications.

### Logo Colors

Our logo is always shown on a single color background unless used on top of a treated brand image. Always ensure that the logo has enough contrast against the background.

<img width="620" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 12 31 37 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14305331-e50f-42c4-8557-65c6aa516589" />


### Improper Usage

Our logo has defined usage guidelines and should never be altered or displayed in the following ways:

❌ **Don't overcomplicate the color mix**
- Stick to a simplified color mix unless displaying the logo on a brand-treated image, in which case the logo should be one brand color; either White Cloud or Encrypted Forest. The logo should be displayed in high-contrast using only the primary brand colors or White Cloud.

❌ **Don't twist, turn or stretch the Jozu logo**
- Use it within the provided ratios.

❌ **Don't apply unapproved effects**
- The Jozu logo should not be displayed with effects other than those approved. No patterns can be applied to the logo.

❌ **Don't change the proportions of the Jozu logo**
- The ratios and proportions of the wordmark and logomark should not be changed in any way when displaying the full lockup.

### Correct Usage

✅ **High-contrast background**
- Ensure the logo has enough contrast against the background

✅ **Applied effects**
- The only approved effect that can be applied to the Jozu logo is a slight under glow using "Subtle glow" (a series of drop shadows). This effect can only be applied in a monotone environment.

✅ **Stacked logo**
- The full Jozu logo lock can be stacked using the same proportions as the horizontal lockup with the bottom of the shield monogram lining up with the top of the tittle on the "j" in the wordmark.

✅ **Monotone on brand images**
- The logo mark, wordmark and full lockup must be monotone when displayed on a brand treated image.

## Color Palette

The Jozu color palette is intentionally focused within a single tonal range — green. This deliberate constraint reflects the elegance and efficiency of the platform: one product, streamlined and unified, yet capable of powering infinite possibilities.

Just as developers can unlock diverse capabilities from a singular foundation, the varying shades of green offer visual flexibility without compromising cohesion. This approach reinforces the idea that simplicity in structure can still yield boundless creativity and depth.

## Typography

Jozu's type system is composed of two complementary typefaces that work in harmony with one another: ABC Diatype, in two weights, paired with ABC Diatype Mono. Together, they are suited for a wide variety of flexible and uniquely tailored communications.

<img width="1260" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 12 34 57 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e8eac17-c3fa-445d-a500-eaec53387f8b" />


### Primary Typeface - ABC Diatype

ABC Diatype is our primary font choice for the Jozu brand and should be used across all branded media.

Diatype is a warm yet sharp grotesque ideal for text and reading on screen. Its name refers to the clunky, pre-digital typesetting machines that informed its shapes and the Swiss Neo-grotesque genre at large.

Diatype is extremely versatile and can generally be used for both display and body text use.

#### ABC Diatype Regular and Medium

For most text applications including headlines, body text, and important communications.

### Secondary Typeface - ABC Diatype Mono

ABC Diatype Mono Regular is our secondary font choice for the Jozu brand and should be used across all branded media.

Diatype Mono was designed specifically as a companion to Diatype and therefore many of the characters share similar shapes and overall design gestures.

Diatype mono should be used in supporting text and detail text. It can be used in situations that may call for a slightly less formal visual direction. It should not be used for core communications, body text, or header text, but rather for circumstances that may benefit from more flexibility.

### Typography Hierarchy

These are the standard font use cases within the Jozu brand. While these guidelines cover most scenarios, slight variations may be necessary in unique or unforeseen situations.

#### Headers
```
H1: ABC Diatype, Regular, 128pt (Kerning: -2.88px)
H2: ABC Diatype, Regular, 64pt (Kerning: -1.55px)
Body Text: ABC Diatype, Regular, 24pt (Kerning: -0.73px)
Mono Text: ABC Diatype Mono, Regular, 16pt (Kerning: 10%)
```

## Image Treatment

The Jozu brand uses imagery to visually express the theme of flow, reinforcing the platform's ease of use and intuitive nature. Photographs featuring flowing water should be treated with a motion blur set to a distance of 563 pixels, applied in the direction that naturally follows the movement of the water within the image.

<img width="656" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 12 35 32 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d9db36c-a3b7-4cc7-baa5-f0b367af8911" />


The second and final step in the treatment is to apply a gradient map using the designated brand colors at the specified gradient stops:

### Gradient Map Values
- #FFFFFF (0%)
- #5BE6B7 (50%)
- #223B3C (100%)

This image treatment reinforces the key themes of flow and elegance, creating a distinctive and cohesive visual identity throughout all Jozu materials.

## Brand Elements

The brand elements are essential in supporting the brand themes visually. They include the following.

### Code Currents

Code Currents represent the continuous, intelligent flow of data throughout the platform — visualized as moving lines with pixel-like nodes that pulse across the environment/screen. These animated elements symbolize the seamless exchange of information between AI agents, models, and applications. 

Like currents in a living system, they are precise, responsive, and always in motion — embodying the brand's core values of speed, flow, and clarity. Whether deploying, securing, or optimizing AI systems, Code Currents remind users that behind every action is a sophisticated, invisible architecture powering it all with skill and ease.

#### Usage Examples

### Code Lock Mono Brackets

Code Lock Mono Brackets are a distinctive typographic device used to frame subheader or meta-level text that introduces key sections of content. Composed of mono-spaced type encased between stylized bracket forms drawn from the shield mark, these elements function as secure containers for high-level cues — signaling structure, clarity, and intent. 

They serve as a visual "code lock," guiding users through the system with confidence and precision. Use Code Lock Mono Brackets to introduce major sections, annotate feature blocks, or highlight key transitions — anywhere a moment of emphasis or guided context is needed before the main message.
